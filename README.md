**NOTE:** Saleae Logic version 2 breaks the built-in SPI analyzer export feature.

As of 12/6/2023 there is no word on whether this will ever be fixed, meaning sniffROM only works with version 1 for the foreseeable future :(

# sniffROM

A tool for passive data capture and reconnaissance of serial flash chips. It is used with a Saleae logic analyzer to reconstruct flash memory contents and extract contextual information about device operations.

* Supports <b>SPI</b> and <b>IÂ²C</b> flash chips.
* Preserves the actual memory addresses of captured data.
* Generates a <b>visual map</b> of the reconstructed binary image.
* Generates a <b>timing plot</b> of reads/writes to memory addresses. 
* Recognizes <b>100+</b> (and currently parses <b>12</b>) SPI flash commands from the following manufacturers:
  * Atmel
  * Eon
  * Fidelix
  * GigaDevice
  * Macronix
  * Numonyx 
  * Spansion
  * SST
  * Winbond

usage: sniffROM_new.py [-h] [--addrlen [{2,3,4}]] [--endian [{msb,lsb}]]
                       [--filter [{r,w}]] [-o [O]] [--summary] [--data-map]

                       input_file

sniffROM - Reconstructs flash memory contents and extracts other data from
passively sniffed commands in a Saleae logic analyzer capture file. Currently
supports SPI and I2C flash chips.

positional arguments:
  input_file            Saleae Logic SPI or I2C Analyzer Export File (.csv)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --addrlen [{2,3,4}]   set length of SPI memory address in bytes (default: 3)
  --endian [{msb,lsb}]  set endianness of SPI memory bytes (default: msb)
  --filter [{r,w}]      analyze only Read or Write commands (default: both)
  -o [O]                flash image output file name (default: output.bin)
  --summary             print summary of sniffed commands and metadata
  --data-map            show visual data map
  --timing-plot         show timing analysis
  -v                    increase verbosity (up to -vvv)
```
